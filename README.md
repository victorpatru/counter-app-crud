# Basic Server-side Counter application
The application allows the user to increase, decrease, and reset the score counter of our application.

## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Node.js (Express), EJS

* Created a API code that allows our server to be able to respond to client-side request
* Set up the client side Javascript to be able to make fetches based on requests made by the user (using event listeners)
* Used MongoDB to store and update our counter using a dedicated databased
* Used EJS to dynamically generate HTML to display to our user based on database information
* 


## Optimizations

* Change the color of the counter based on whether the item is above or below zero
* Reset the counter after a certain time has passed without any user input


## Lessons Learned:

* Creating a API code on the server that knows how to listen for client requests
* Created a front-end that is able to make fetch requests to the server
* Used EJS to dynamically render information by injecting it into a HTML template
